		<p>now my friends, the real question is- why am i not tired?? First of all I'm working and going to school together. yes at the same time. Now it probably isn't a big deal but when you suck at time management then shit it does matter. It sucks! ok my communte also adds to it. Takes me an hour to get to school and an hour to get to work. although going to work from school isnt SO bad but still. Ok so. I just want to rest and be able to do things I want to do. But my time management sucks so instead of working on code after work I am still waiting for my train at 3 am in the morning because of some drunk guy who almost killed himself like damn. I know youre hurting but don't hurt yourself and hurt us too! my god. </p>
